# Transloadit Node.js SDK [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/transloadit/node-sdk.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/transloadit/node-sdk)

A **Node** integration for [Transloadit](https://transloadit.com)'s file
uploading and encoding service.

## Intro

[Transloadit](https://transloadit.com) is a service that helps you handle file
uploads, resize, crop and watermark your images, make GIFs, transcode your
videos, extract thumbnails, generate audio waveforms, and so much more. In
short, [Transloadit](https://transloadit.com) is the Swiss Army Knife for your
files.

This is a **Node** SDK to make it easy to talk to the
[Transloadit](https://transloadit.com) REST API.

## Install

Inside your project, type

```bash
npm install transloadit --save
```

If there are no errors, you can start using the module.

## Usage

```javascript
const TransloaditClient = require('transloadit')
const transloadit       = new TransloaditClient({
  authKey   : 'YOUR_TRANSLOADIT_KEY',
  authSecret: 'YOUR_TRANSLOADIT_SECRET'
})

transloadit.addFile('file1', '/PATH/TO/FILE.jpg');

const assemblyOptions = {
  params: {
    template_id: 'YOUR_TEMPLATE_ID'
  }
}

transloadit.createAssembly(assemblyOptions, (err, result) => {
  if (err) {
    throw err
  }

  console.log('✅ success')

  let assemblyId = result.assembly_id

  console.log({
    assemblyId: assemblyId
  })

  transloadit.deleteAssembly(assemblyId, (err) => {
    console.log('✅ deleted')
  })
})
```

## Example

For fully working examples take a look at
[`examples/`](https://github.com/transloadit/node-sdk/tree/master/examples).

## API

These are the public methods on the `TransloaditClient` object and their descriptions.

### Main

#### constructor([options])

Returns a new instance of the client. The `options` object must at least include `authKey` and `authSecret` keys (and their values).

You can also provide `service`, which defaults to `'api2.transloadit.com'`, and `region`, which defaults to `'us-east-1'`.

By default `TransloaditClient` will use SSL so it will access `service` with a https:// prefix. You can switch this off by providing options.useSsl with a value of `false`.

#### calcSignature(params)

Calculates a signature for the given `params` JSON object. If the `params` object does not include an `authKey` or `expires` keys (and their values) in the `auth` sub-key, then they are set automatically.

This function returns an object with the key `signature` (containing the calculated signature string) and a key `params`, which contains the stringified version of the passed `params` object (including the set expires and authKey keys).

### Assemblies

#### TransloaditClient.addFile(name, path)

Registers the local file with the client. The next call to `createAssembly` will upload that file.

#### TransloaditClient.addStream(name, stream)

Registers the provided stream with the client. The next call to `createAssembly` will upload that stream.

#### TransloaditClient.createAssembly(options, cb)

Creates a new assembly on Transloadit, uploading all streams and files that were registered via `.addStream()` and `.addFile()` prior to the call to `.createAssembly()`.

You can provide some options:

* `params` - an object containing your `template_id`, `notify_url`, some steps that overwrite your Transloadit template and other params to control Transloadit behavior.
* `fields` - an object of form fields to add to the request, to make use of in the assembly via [assembly variables](https://transloadit.com/docs#assembly-variables).
* `waitForCompletion` - A boolean (default is `false`) to indicate whether you want to wait for the assembly to finish with all encoding results present before the callback is called.

This function (like all functions of this client) automatically obeys all rate limiting imposed by Transloadit. There is no need to write your own
wrapper scripts to handle rate limits.

#### TransloaditClient.lastUsedAssemblyUrl()

Returns the internal url that was used for the last call to `Transloadit.createAssembly()`. This is meant to be used for debugging purposes.

#### TransloaditClient.listAssemblies(params, cb)

Retrieves an array of assemblies according to the given `params`.

Valid params can be page, pagesize, type, fromdate and todate. Please consult the [Transloadit API docs](https://transloadit.com/docs/api-docs/#retrieve-assembly-list) for details.

#### TransloaditClient.streamAssemblies(params)

Creates an objectMode readable stream that automates handling of listAssembly
pagination. It accepts the same params as listAssembly.

This can be used to iterate through assemblies:

```javascript
var assemblyStream = client.streamAssemblies({ fromdate: '2016-08-19 01:15:00 UTC' });

assemblyStream.on('readable', function() {
  var assembly = assemblyStream.read();
  if (assembly == null) console.log('end of stream');

  console.log(assembly.id);
});
```

Results can also be piped. Here's an example using
[through2](https://github.com/rvagg/through2):

```javascript
var assemblyStream = client.streamAssemblies({ fromdate: '2016-08-19 01:15:00 UTC' });

assemblyStream
  .pipe(through.obj(function(chunk, enc, callback) {
    this.push(chunk.id + '\n');
    callback();
  }))
  .pipe(fs.createWriteStream('assemblies.txt'));
```

#### TransloaditClient.getAssembly(assemblyId, cb)

Retrieves the JSON status of the assembly identified by the given `assemblyId`.

#### TransloaditClient.deleteAssembly(assemblyId, cb)

Removes the assembly identified by the given `assemblyId` from the memory of the Transloadit machines, ultimately cancelling it. This does not delete the assembly from the database - you can still access it on `https://transloadit.com/assemblies/{assembly_id}` in your Transloadit account. This also does not delete any files associated with the assembly from the Transloadit servers.

#### TransloaditClient.replayAssembly(options, cb)

Replays the assembly identified by the given `assembly_id`. The `options` parameter must contain an `assembly_id` key containing the assembly id. Optionally you can also provide a `notify_url` key if you want to change the notification target.

### Assembly notifications

#### TransloaditClient.replayAssemblyNotification(options, cb)

Replays the notification for the assembly identified by the given `assembly_id`.  The `options` parameter must contain an `assembly_id` key containing the assembly id. Optionally you can also provide a `notify_url` key if you want to change the notification target.

#### TransloaditClient.listAssemblyNotifications(params, cb)

Retrieves an array of assembly notifications according to the given `params`.

Valid params can be `page`, `pagesize`, `type` and `assembly_id`. Please consult the [Transloadit API docs](https://transloadit.com/docs/api-docs/#retrieve-assembly-notification-list) for details.

#### TransloaditClient.streamAssemblyNotifications(params)

Creates an objectMode readable stream like streamAssemblies that automates
handling of listAssemblynotifications pagination.

### Templates

#### TransloaditClient.createTemplate(params, cb)

Creates a template the provided params. The required `params` keys are: name (the template name) and template (the template JSON string).

#### TransloaditClient.editTemplate(templateId, params, cb)

Updates the template represented by the given `templateId` with the new value. The `params` works just like the one from the `createTemplate` call.

#### TransloaditClient.getTemplate(templateId, cb)

Retrieves the name and the template JSON for the template represented by the given templateId.

#### TransloaditClient.deleteTemplate(templateId, cb)

Deletes the template represented by the given templateId on Transloadit.

#### TransloaditClient.listTemplates(params, cb)

Retrieves a list of all your templates from Transloadit. The `params` parameter can contain properties such as `order`, `sort`, and `page`. For a list of all available params please check [this entry](https://transloadit.com/docs/api-docs/#retrieve-template-list) in the Transloadit API docs.

#### TransloaditClient.streamTemplates(params)

Creates an objectMode readable stream like streamAssemblies that automates
handling of listTemplates pagination.

## Contributing

We'd be happy to accept pull requests. If you plan on working on something big, please first drop us a line!

### Building

The SDK is written in ES6, but the ES5 JavaScript it generates is committed back into the repository so people can use this module without a ES6 dependency. If you want to work on the source, please do so in `./src` and type: `npm run build` or `npm run test` (also builds first). Please don't edit generated JavaScript in `./lib`!

### Testing

Check your sources for linting errors via `npm run lint`, and unit tests, and run them via `npm run test`, or `npm run mocha` for faster iterations.

### Releasing

Releasing a new version to npmjs.org can be done via `npm run release:major` (or minor / patch, depending on the [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/) impact of your changes). This will automatically:

 - Bump the version inside the `package.json`
 - Save a release commit with the updated version in Git
 - Push a tag to Github
 - Publish to npmjs.org

### Convenience

If you come from a unix background and fancy faster auto-complete, you'll be delighted to know that all npm scripts are also accessible under `make`, via fakefile.
